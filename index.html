    <h1>Home Design Inspiration</h1>
    <p>
      I like a home design experience that blends creativity, comfort, and modern style. 
      I believe every space has a story, and my mission is to bring that story to life 
      with thoughtful design solutions. From refreshing a single room to transforming your 
      entire home, I focus on clean aesthetics, functional layouts, and personalised 
      touches that reflect your lifestyle. With an eye for detail and a passion for beautiful 
      spaces, I help you create a home that feels inspiring, harmonious, and uniquely yours. 
      Let me turn your vision into a place you truly love coming back to every day.
